### **Notes on the Task**

In the initial task description, it was mentioned:  
> Currently, the project only has a dynamic background applied to the dashboard page, while the Properties page and other pages do not have any backgrounds. Your task is to set static backgrounds for these pages.

When I launched the application, I didn’t see a dynamic background applied to the dashboard page, but I did find a slider with 3 images. Meanwhile, other pages already had static backgrounds, which appear to be the same slider. Therefore, I wasn’t completely sure about the exact task.

- I added the `detail-carousel.tsx` component — a carousel for the property card.  
- I updated `property-detail.tsx` — the property card.  

Overall, the project looks like a boilerplate on Next.js — it’s hard to tell what it’s meant to be so far. It feels like a layout for some catalog, with pieces of backend that don’t yet interact with the frontend.

Please note that I am not interested in hands-on frontend development. I’m already leading on several large-scale projects that bring real revenue to companies. However, I am generally interested in web3/products, provided that the company has an understanding of tokenomics models and has SMEs in the respective domains. Otherwise, such projects don’t make much sense for me.
